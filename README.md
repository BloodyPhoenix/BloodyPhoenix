- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BloodyPhoenix
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python-backend development, databases, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with Python, learning more about Django REST Framework and how to work in Test Driven Development paradigm. I realy love Django+TDD and aim to test all the things that could be tested. I also strive to learn how to work with other frameworks using TDD.
